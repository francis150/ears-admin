# ðŸ•° EARS Admin (Desktop App)

**E**lectornic **A**ttendance **R**eal-time **S**olution

This project was the one I made when I was still in school and this was my first time learning `NodeJS`. It was a disaster! ðŸ˜‚ But nonetheless, I still want to share this with you guys. 

This app is a real-time employee attendance solution mainly targeted for **multi-branch businesses**.

This app is the admin side of the solution. It is used by the management or administration of the business(Manager, HR, Owner).
