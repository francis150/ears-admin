# Eears Admin
This is a project I made when I was first learning `Node.js` and it was a disaster! ðŸ˜‚ 

This app is a realtime employee attendance monitoring app mainly targeted for **muti-branch business**.

This app is the admin side of the solution. It is used by the management or administration of the business(Manager, HR, Owner).
